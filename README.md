üîç I'm a dedicated smart contract security researcher, specializing in auditing Rust and Solidity-based contracts on Ethereum , Polkadot , Fuel , and any other ecosystem . Leveraging my expertise on platforms like Code4rena, I dive deep into the code to unearth vulnerabilities that could compromise the blockchain ecosystem ü¶Ä

üõ†Ô∏è My work focuses on fortifying the security of smart contracts through meticulous audits, with a passion for enhancing the blockchain's integrity. Beyond identifying risks, I contribute to developing innovative solutions aimed at preempting security flaws.
